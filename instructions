Virtualization:

Create a My VMware account and download and install the free ESXi hypervisor (version 6) on your spare hardware. Keep in mind, this is a 
destructive operation, so back up any important data before starting.

Create a Red Hat developer account. This is free and gets you a subscription which lets you download Red Hat OS installers and patches:
http://developers.redhat.com
http://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/get-started/

Once configured, please create one OS X virtual machine and two Red Hat Linux virtual machines. OS 10.11.5 for the Mac, and Red Hat 7 
for Linux. Depending on the hardware resources available to you, you may only be able to do one OS X VM and one Linux VM, which is 
fine as well. Apply all OS updates and patches.

• On the OS X VM, install Server.app and create an SMB file share.

• On the Linux VM 1, install the latest versions of Apache web server, OpenSSL, and mod_ssl. 

• On Linux VM 2, install MySQL database server, version 5.6.31.

# How to enjoy Mac OS X El Capitan on Non-Apple Hardware - Say Thanks to Vmware ESXi


So, the first thing you need to do is to customise the hypervisor layer by executing an Unlocker script by insanelymac.com. 
Please note that you will need to register on the site in order to download the Unlocker tool. You need to enable SSH on your ESXi host.
In order to do that, login to the host using VMware vShpere Client and navigate to Configuration->Security Profile. From here click on 
Properties in the upper right corner where it says Services. The dialog Services Properties should appear and from here you can click 
on SSH->Options and choose Start and stop with host. Click Start and then close all the open dialogs.
Transfer the Unlocker-files to the host using any SFTP client. Make sure you extract the files somewhere on your client before transfer 
and connect to the ESXi host using the user root. Once connected navigate to /vmfs/volumes/datastore01/ , replacing datastore01 with 
your actual datastore name. Create a new folder (mkdir) called tools and transfer your unlockerXXX directory. Now cd into the uploaded
directory and ensure the ESXi scripts have execute permissions by running chmod +x esxi-install.sh. Now run ./esxi-install.sh in order 
to install the Unlocker. Reboot the ESXi host.
 

Download and create the bootable OS X El Capitan ISO

Grab the El Capitan installer app from the Apple Appstore. Note, you need  a real Mac in order to download and convert the El Capitan 
installation disk. Once downloaded minimize or close the installer.

Open the terminal and change directory to /tmp using command cd /tmp

Create a new script file: nano ElCapitan.sh

Paste the following into the script file and save:

#!/bin/bash
# Mount the installer image
hdiutil attach /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_app

# Create the ElCapitan Blank ISO Image of 7316mb with a Single Partition - Apple Partition Map
hdiutil create -o /tmp/ElCapitan.cdr -size 7316m -layout SPUD -fs HFS+J

# Mount the ElCapitan Blank ISO Image
hdiutil attach /tmp/ElCapitan.cdr.dmg -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_build

# Restore the Base System into the ElCapitan Blank ISO Image
asr restore -source /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.dmg -target /Volumes/install_build -noprompt -noverify -erase

# Remove Package link and replace with actual files
rm /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/System/Installation/Packages
cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/Packages /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/System/Installation/

# Copy El Capitan installer dependencies
cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.chunklist /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/BaseSystem.chunklist
cp -rp /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.dmg /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/BaseSystem.dmg

# Unmount the installer image
hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_app

# Unmount the ElCapitan ISO Image
hdiutil detach /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/

# Convert the ElCapitan ISO Image to ISO/CD master (Optional)
hdiutil convert /tmp/ElCapitan.cdr.dmg -format UDTO -o /tmp/ElCapitan.iso

# Rename the ElCapitan ISO Image and move it to the desktop
mv /tmp/ElCapitan.iso.cdr ~/Desktop/ElCapitan.iso

Now ensure that the script file has execute permissions by running chmod +x ElCapitan.sh and run with sh ./ElCapitan.sh. 
This will take some time, so just be patient. Once done it should have created a file called ElCapitan.iso on your desktop.

Create a virtual Mac OS X VM

The next step should be fairly simple if you have used ESXi before. As usual open your datastore and transfer the iso to wherever 
you normally store your installation files. Then create a new vm, select Typical and you should be able to select Other and then 
Apple Mac OS X 10.10 (64-bit). Complete the wizard, mount the ISO and install Mac OS X as usual. Please note that you must format 
the hard drive using the disk utility before it will be visible in the install wizard.

Configure Mac OS X

It’s very important to install the VMware Tools as soon as possible after the install has finished. Without it Mac OS X might not awake 
from sleep and in general be very unreliable. I recommend to turn off sleep and the screensaver in settings as these may cause issues. 

Finally, reboot and start enjoying your virtual Mac on non-Apple hardware.
